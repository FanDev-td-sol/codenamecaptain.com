                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Founded in 2020, CodenameCaptain was born from a simple vision: to create immersive gaming experiences that transport players to extraordinary worlds. What began as a small team of passionate developers working out of a garage has grown into a dynamic studio dedicated to pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.</p>
                <p>Our journey started with a single game prototype that combined detective mysteries with puzzle-solving mechanics. The positive response from early testers encouraged us to expand our horizons, leading to the development of our current collection featuring detective, underwater, and pirate-themed adventures.</p>
